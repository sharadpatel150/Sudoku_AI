# 🧠 Sudoku Using AI Techniques

This project implements and compares different AI-based search algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles. It models Sudoku as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** and evaluates the efficiency of various algorithms based on execution time and nodes explored.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Load Sudoku puzzles from CSV files
- ✅ Select solver algorithm via CLI
- ✅ Implemented Solvers:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS / Backtracking)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- 📊 Performance metrics:
  - Execution time
  - Nodes explored
- 🧪 Evaluation on multiple difficulty levels
- 🔄 Easily extendable to Greedy and A\* in future
